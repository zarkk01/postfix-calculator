# PostFixie: Your Friendly Neighborhood Postfix Calculator

Hello there! Welcome to the world of PostFixie, a stack-based postfix calculator built with Java and Maven. PostFixie is not just any calculator, it's a calculator with a twist!

## What's the Twist?

Well, PostFixie doesn't believe in the traditional way of doing math. No sir! It follows the postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). So instead of typing `2 + 2`, you would type `2 2 +`. It's like Yoda doing math!
